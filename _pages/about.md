I am a research fellow at the University of Ottawa, working with Prof. [Lionel Briand](https://www.lbriand.info).

I received my Ph.D. in Software Engineering from Nanjing University in 2023, co-supervised by Prof. Bin Luo, Prof. [Jidong Ge](https://gjdnju.github.io), and Dr. [Chuanyi Li](http://lichuanyi.site/publication.html). Since 2022, I have been collaborating with Prof. [Alexander Egyed](http://140.78.115.16/alexander.egyed/), Prof. [Liguo Huang](https://s2.smu.edu/~lghuang/), Prof. [Wesley K. G. Assun√ß√£o](https://wesleyklewerton.github.io), and Dr. [Christoph Mayr-Dorn](https://christophdorn.wordpress.com) on refactoring-based bug localization and defect prediction research. Before that, I received my B.S. in Software Engineering from Tianjin University in 2018.
